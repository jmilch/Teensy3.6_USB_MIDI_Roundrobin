# Teensy3.6_USB_MIDI_Roundrobin
Roundrobin Midi Channel changer for Teensy 3.6 using USB Host port

The goal of this project is to use an USB MIDI Keyboard connected to the USB Host Port of a Teensy 3.6 (4 should work as well)
to play multiple different voices on a synth (e.g. Elektron Models Cycles)
connected via USB or Hardware Serial Midi
by rotating the notes played across several midi channels .
